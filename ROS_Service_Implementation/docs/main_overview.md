# Code Overview: main.cpp

This C++ code demonstrates a **client-server architecture** using a **ROS (Robot Operating System)** framework. ROS is commonly used in robotics for communication between different components of a robotic system. The code implements a simple service where a client sends a request to a server to add two integers, and the server responds with the sum.

### **Purpose and Main Functionality**
The purpose of this code is to:
1. **Create a server** that listens for requests to add two integers.
2. **Create a client** that sends a request to the server with two integers.
3. **Compute the sum** of the two integers on the server and return the result to the client.
4. **Print the results** of the computation for debugging and verification.

This is a basic example of how services work in ROS, where one node (the client) requests a computation from another node (the server), and the server performs the computation and sends back the result.

### **Algorithms Used**
The code does not use any complex algorithms. It simply performs the following steps:
1. **Addition**: The server adds two integers (`req.a` and `req.b`) and stores the result in `res.sum`.
2. **Service Communication**: The client sends a request to the server, and the server processes the request and sends back a response.

---

### **Overall Structure**
The code is divided into two main parts:
1. **Server-Side Logic**:
   - A function `addTwoInts` is defined to handle the service request. It takes two arguments: a request (`ROS::AddTwoIntsRequest`) and a response (`ROS::AddTwoIntsResponse`).
   - The function computes the sum of the two integers in the request and stores the result in the response.
   - It also prints the request and result for debugging purposes.

2. **Client-Side Logic**:
   - The `main` function creates a server and advertises the `add_two_ints` service.
   - It then creates a client to call the service.
   - The client prepares a request with two integers (`5` and `3`), sends the request to the server, and waits for the response.
   - Finally, it prints whether the service call succeeded or failed and displays the result.

---

### **How the Parts Work Together**
1. **Server Initialization**:
   - The server is created and advertised using `ROS::advertise_service`. This tells ROS that the server is ready to handle requests for the `add_two_ints` service.
   - The `addTwoInts` function is registered as the callback function to handle incoming requests.

2. **Client Initialization**:
   - The client is created using `ROS::serviceClient`. It connects to the `add_two_ints` service.
   - The client prepares a request (`ROS::AddTwoIntsRequest`) with two integers (`5` and `3`).

3. **Service Call**:
   - The client sends the request to the server using `client.call(req, res)`.
   - The server processes the request by calling the `addTwoInts` function, which computes the sum and stores it in the response (`ROS::AddTwoIntsResponse`).
   - The server sends the response back to the client.

4. **Result Handling**:
   - The client checks if the service call succeeded and prints the result (`res.sum`).
   - If the call fails, it prints an error message.

### **Problem Being Solved**
The problem being solved is a simple demonstration of **inter-process communication** in ROS. It shows how one node (the client) can request a computation from another node (the server) and receive the result. This is a fundamental concept in distributed systems, where different components of a system need to communicate and collaborate.

---

### **Approach Taken**
The approach taken is straightforward:
1. **Define a Service**: The service is defined to take two integers as input and return their sum.
2. **Implement the Server**: The server listens for requests and processes them using the `addTwoInts` function.
3. **Implement the Client**: The client sends a request to the server and waits for the response.
4. **Handle Errors**: The client checks if the service call succeeded and handles errors gracefully.

---

### **Key Concepts in the Code**
1. **Service**: A service in ROS is a communication mechanism where a client sends a request to a server, and the server sends back a response.
2. **Request and Response**: The request (`ROS::AddTwoIntsRequest`) contains the input data (two integers), and the response (`ROS::AddTwoIntsResponse`) contains the output data (the sum).
3. **Callback Function**: The `addTwoInts` function is a callback that the server calls whenever it receives a request.
4. **Service Call**: The client uses `client.call(req, res)` to send a request and wait for a response.

---

### **Summary**
This code demonstrates a basic ROS service where a client requests the sum of two integers from a server. The server computes the sum and returns the result to the client. The code is structured to show how services work in ROS, with clear separation between the server and client logic. It is a simple yet effective example of inter-process communication in a distributed system.
