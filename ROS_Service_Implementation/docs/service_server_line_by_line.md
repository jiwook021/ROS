# Step-by-Step Explanation: service_server.cpp

Let’s dive into the code step by step, breaking it down into digestible parts and explaining everything in detail. I’ll start from the top and work our way down, ensuring that every line is clear and understandable.

---

### **1. Header Inclusion**
```cpp
#include "service_common.h"
#include <iostream>
```

#### **What it does:**
- These lines include external files that the code needs to work.
- `#include "service_common.h"` includes a custom header file, likely containing definitions for `AddTwoIntsRequest`, `AddTwoIntsResponse`, and `serviceClient`.
- `#include <iostream>` includes the standard input/output library, which is used for printing messages to the console.

#### **Why it’s used:**
- **`service_common.h`**: This file likely contains shared definitions and declarations used across multiple files in the project. By including it, the code can use types like `AddTwoIntsRequest` and `AddTwoIntsResponse` without redefining them.
- **`<iostream>`**: This library is used for basic console output, such as printing messages when the service is advertised or shut down.

---

### **2. Namespace Declaration**
```cpp
namespace ROS {
```

#### **What it does:**
- This line declares a **namespace** called `ROS`. A namespace is like a container that groups related code together to avoid naming conflicts with other code.

#### **Why it’s used:**
- Namespaces help organize code and prevent issues where two pieces of code might use the same name for different things. For example, if another library also defines a `serviceServer` class, the `ROS` namespace ensures there’s no confusion.

---

### **3. Class Definition**
```cpp
class serviceServer {
```

#### **What it does:**
- This defines a **class** called `serviceServer`. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class. In this case, the `serviceServer` class represents a service server that can handle requests.

#### **Why it’s used:**
- Classes allow us to encapsulate related data and functionality into a single unit. Here, the `serviceServer` class encapsulates everything needed to manage a service, including its name, callback function, and lifecycle.

---

### **4. Callback Type Alias**
```cpp
using CallbackType = std::function<bool(AddTwoIntsRequest&, AddTwoIntsResponse&)>;
```

#### **What it does:**
- This line defines a **type alias** called `CallbackType`. It specifies that `CallbackType` is a function that takes two arguments (`AddTwoIntsRequest&` and `AddTwoIntsResponse&`) and returns a `bool`.

#### **Why it’s used:**
- **`std::function`**: This is a C++ utility that can store any callable object (like a function or lambda). By using `std::function`, the code can accept any function that matches the specified signature.
- **Type alias**: This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. Instead of writing `std::function<bool(AddTwoIntsRequest&, AddTwoIntsResponse&)>` everywhere, we can just use `CallbackType`.

#### **Example:**
If we have a function like this:
```cpp
bool addTwoInts(AddTwoIntsRequest& req, AddTwoIntsResponse& res) {
    res.sum = req.a + req.b;
    return true;
}
```
We can pass it to the `serviceServer` as a `CallbackType`.

---

### **5. Constructor**
```cpp
serviceServer(const std::string& service_name, CallbackType callback)
    : service_name_(service_name), callback_(callback) {
    serviceClient::registerServer(service_name_, this);
    std::cout << "Service '" << service_name_ << "' advertised." << std::endl;
}
```

#### **What it does:**
- This is the **constructor** for the `serviceServer` class. It is called when a `serviceServer` object is created.
- It takes two arguments:
  1. `service_name`: The name of the service (e.g., `"add_two_ints"`).
  2. `callback`: The function that will handle requests.
- The constructor initializes the `service_name_` and `callback_` member variables using an **initializer list** (`: service_name_(service_name), callback_(callback)`).
- It then registers the server with the `serviceClient` and prints a message to the console.

#### **Why it’s used:**
- **Initializer list**: This is used to initialize member variables before the constructor body runs. It’s more efficient than assigning values inside the constructor body.
- **Registration**: The server needs to register itself so that clients can find and use it. This is done by calling `serviceClient::registerServer`.
- **Console output**: The message informs the user that the service is now available.

#### **Example:**
If we create a `serviceServer` like this:
```cpp
serviceServer server("add_two_ints", addTwoInts);
```
The constructor will:
1. Store `"add_two_ints"` in `service_name_`.
2. Store the `addTwoInts` function in `callback_`.
3. Register the server.
4. Print: `Service 'add_two_ints' advertised.`

---

### **6. Destructor**
```cpp
~serviceServer() {
    serviceClient::unregisterServer(service_name_);
    std::cout << "Service '" << service_name_ << "' shut down." << std::endl;
}
```

#### **What it does:**
- This is the **destructor** for the `serviceServer` class. It is called when a `serviceServer` object is destroyed (e.g., goes out of scope).
- It unregisters the server and prints a message to the console.

#### **Why it’s used:**
- **Unregistration**: This ensures the server is no longer available for clients, preventing issues like dangling references.
- **Console output**: The message informs the user that the service has been shut down.

#### **Example:**
If the `serviceServer` object goes out of scope, the destructor will:
1. Unregister the server.
2. Print: `Service 'add_two_ints' shut down.`

---

### **7. Request Handling Method**
```cpp
bool handleRequest(AddTwoIntsRequest& req, AddTwoIntsResponse& res) {
    return callback_(req, res);
}
```

#### **What it does:**
- This method handles incoming requests by calling the user-provided callback function (`callback_`).
- It passes the request (`req`) and response (`res`) objects to the callback and returns the result.

#### **Why it’s used:**
- **Flexibility**: By delegating request processing to a callback, the server can handle different types of requests without modifying its core logic.
- **Separation of concerns**: The server focuses on managing the service lifecycle, while the callback handles the specific request logic.

#### **Example:**
If a client sends a request, the server will call:
```cpp
bool result = server.handleRequest(req, res);
```
This will invoke the callback function (e.g., `addTwoInts`) and return its result.

---

### **8. Member Variables**
```cpp
private:
    std::string service_name_;
    CallbackType callback_;
```

#### **What it does:**
- These are the **member variables** of the `serviceServer` class.
- `service_name_` stores the name of the service.
- `callback_` stores the callback function used to handle requests.

#### **Why it’s used:**
- **Encapsulation**: These variables are private, meaning they can only be accessed within the class. This protects the internal state of the server.

---

### **9. Helper Function**
```cpp
serviceServer advertise_service(const std::string& service_name,
                               bool (*callback)(AddTwoIntsRequest&, AddTwoIntsResponse&)) {
    return serviceServer(service_name, callback);
}
```

#### **What it does:**
- This function creates and returns a `serviceServer` object.
- It takes the service name and a callback function as arguments and passes them to the `serviceServer` constructor.

#### **Why it’s used:**
- **Convenience**: This function provides a simpler way to create a `serviceServer` object without directly calling the constructor.
- **Type conversion**: It converts a raw function pointer into a `CallbackType` (which is a `std::function`).

#### **Example:**
Instead of:
```cpp
serviceServer server("add_two_ints", addTwoInts);
```
You can write:
```cpp
auto server = advertise_service("add_two_ints", addTwoInts);
```

---

### **10. Namespace Closing**
```cpp
} // namespace ROS
```

#### **What it does:**
- This closes the `ROS` namespace, ending the scope of the `serviceServer` class and `advertise_service` function.

#### **Why it’s used:**
- It ensures that all the code within the `ROS` namespace is properly enclosed.

---

### **Summary**
This code defines a service server that:
1. Registers itself with a unique name.
2. Handles requests using a user-provided callback function.
3. Cleans up when it is no longer needed.

By breaking it down step by step, we’ve explored how each part works and why it’s designed the way it is. This code is a great example of encapsulation, flexibility, and resource management in C++.
