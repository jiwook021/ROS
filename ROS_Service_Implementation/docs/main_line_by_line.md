# Step-by-Step Explanation: main.cpp

Absolutely! Let’s break down the code **line by line** and explain it in a way that’s accessible to everyone, regardless of their programming experience. I’ll explain **what each part does**, **why it’s used**, and **how it fits into the bigger picture**. I’ll also define any technical terms and use examples to make things clearer.

---

### **Code Breakdown**

#### **1. Header Files**
```cpp
#include "service_common.h"
#include <iostream>
```

- **What it does**: These lines include external files that the program needs to run.
  - `#include "service_common.h"`: This includes a custom header file, likely defining the ROS service types (`ROS::AddTwoIntsRequest` and `ROS::AddTwoIntsResponse`).
  - `#include <iostream>`: This includes the standard C++ library for input/output operations, like printing to the console.

- **Why it’s used**: Header files allow the program to use code defined elsewhere. For example, `service_common.h` likely defines the structure of the service request and response, while `<iostream>` provides tools for printing messages.

---

#### **2. The `addTwoInts` Function**
```cpp
bool addTwoInts(ROS::AddTwoIntsRequest& req, ROS::AddTwoIntsResponse& res) {
    res.sum = req.a + req.b;
    std::cout << "Request: " << req.a << " + " << req.b << " = " << res.sum << std::endl;
    return true;
}
```

- **What it does**: This is a **callback function** that the server calls when it receives a request. It takes two arguments:
  - `req`: A request object containing two integers (`req.a` and `req.b`).
  - `res`: A response object where the result (`res.sum`) will be stored.

- **Step-by-step logic**:
  1. **Compute the sum**: `res.sum = req.a + req.b` adds the two integers from the request and stores the result in the response.
  2. **Print the request and result**: The `std::cout` statement prints a message like `"Request: 5 + 3 = 8"` to the console.
  3. **Return `true`**: This indicates that the service call was successful.

- **Why it’s used**: This function defines the behavior of the server. When the server receives a request, it uses this function to process the request and generate a response.

- **Technical terms**:
  - **Callback function**: A function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later (in this case, when the server receives a request).
  - **Request and Response**: These are objects that hold data. The request contains input data (`a` and `b`), and the response contains output data (`sum`).

---

#### **3. The `main` Function**
The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It sets up the server, creates a client, and makes a service call.

##### **3.1. Server Initialization**
```cpp
ROS::serviceServer server = ROS::advertise_service("add_two_ints", addTwoInts);
```

- **What it does**: This line creates a server and advertises a service named `"add_two_ints"`. The server will use the `addTwoInts` function to handle requests.

- **Why it’s used**: The server needs to be set up so it can listen for incoming requests. Advertising the service tells ROS that this server is ready to handle requests for `"add_two_ints"`.

- **Technical terms**:
  - **Service Server**: A component that listens for requests and sends back responses.
  - **Advertise**: In ROS, this means making a service available for other nodes to use.

---

##### **3.2. Client Initialization**
```cpp
ROS::serviceClient client("add_two_ints");
```

- **What it does**: This line creates a client that can send requests to the `"add_two_ints"` service.

- **Why it’s used**: The client needs to connect to the service so it can send requests and receive responses.

- **Technical terms**:
  - **Service Client**: A component that sends requests to a service and waits for responses.

---

##### **3.3. Preparing the Request**
```cpp
ROS::AddTwoIntsRequest req;
req.a = 5;
req.b = 3;
```

- **What it does**: These lines create a request object and set its fields (`a` and `b`) to `5` and `3`, respectively.

- **Why it’s used**: The client needs to send data to the server. The request object holds this data.

- **Example**: If `req.a = 5` and `req.b = 3`, the server will compute `5 + 3 = 8`.

---

##### **3.4. Making the Service Call**
```cpp
ROS::AddTwoIntsResponse res;
if (client.call(req, res)) {
    std::cout << "Service call succeeded: " << res.sum << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "Service call failed." << std::endl;
}
```

- **What it does**: This block sends the request to the server and waits for the response.
  1. **Create a response object**: `ROS::AddTwoIntsResponse res` creates an object to hold the server’s response.
  2. **Call the service**: `client.call(req, res)` sends the request (`req`) to the server and stores the response in `res`.
  3. **Check if the call succeeded**: The `if` statement checks whether the service call was successful.
     - If successful, it prints the result (`res.sum`).
     - If failed, it prints an error message.

- **Why it’s used**: The client needs to send the request and handle the server’s response. The `if` statement ensures that the program behaves correctly even if the service call fails.

- **Technical terms**:
  - **Service Call**: The process of sending a request to a service and receiving a response.

---

##### **3.5. Program Termination**
```cpp
return 0;
```

- **What it does**: This line ends the program and returns `0` to indicate successful execution.

- **Why it’s used**: In C++, `return 0` from `main` indicates that the program ran without errors.

### **Control Flow Diagram**
Here’s a simple text-based diagram to illustrate the flow of the program:

```
Start
  |
  v
Initialize Server (advertise "add_two_ints" service)
  |
  v
Initialize Client (connect to "add_two_ints" service)
  |
  v
Prepare Request (set req.a = 5, req.b = 3)
  |
  v
Send Request to Server (client.call(req, res))
  |
  v
Server Processes Request (addTwoInts function)
  |
  v
Server Sends Response (res.sum = 8)
  |
  v
Client Receives Response
  |
  v
Print Result ("Service call succeeded: 8")
  |
  v
End
```

---

### **Why This Approach is Used**
1. **Modularity**: The server and client are separate components, making the code easier to maintain and extend.
2. **Reusability**: The `addTwoInts` function can handle any request to add two integers, not just `5` and `3`.
3. **Error Handling**: The `if` statement ensures the program handles service call failures gracefully.
4. **Debugging**: Printing the request and result helps developers verify that the program is working correctly.

---

### **Summary**
This code demonstrates a simple client-server interaction in ROS. The server listens for requests to add two integers, and the client sends a request and prints the result. Each part of the code has a clear purpose, and the control flow is easy to follow. By breaking down the code step by step, we can see how the different components work together to solve the problem.
