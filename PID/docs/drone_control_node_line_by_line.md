# Step-by-Step Explanation: drone_control_node.cpp

Let’s break down the code **step by step** in a way that’s easy to understand, even for someone new to programming. I’ll explain each significant section, define technical terms, and provide examples to clarify complex ideas. We’ll also explore the **why** behind the design choices.

### **1. Header Files and Includes**
```cpp
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <geometry_msgs/Twist.h>
#include <geometry_msgs/Point.h>
#include <gazebo_msgs/ModelStates.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <atomic>
```

#### **What It Does**
These lines include external libraries and headers that the program needs to function. Think of them as "toolboxes" that provide specific functionality.

#### **Breakdown**
- **`ros/ros.h`**: The main ROS library, which allows the program to communicate with other ROS nodes (e.g., Gazebo).
- **`geometry_msgs/Twist.h`**: Provides a message type for velocity commands (linear and angular).
- **`geometry_msgs/Point.h`**: Provides a message type for 3D positions (X, Y, Z).
- **`gazebo_msgs/ModelStates.h`**: Provides a message type for the states of all models in Gazebo (e.g., their positions).
- **`iostream`**: Used for input/output (e.g., printing to the console).
- **`vector`**: A dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size.
- **`sstream`**: Used for string manipulation (e.g., converting numbers to strings).
- **`cmath`**: Provides mathematical functions (e.g., `sqrt`, `pow`).
- **`thread`**: Allows the program to run multiple tasks concurrently.
- **`mutex`**: Used to protect shared data from being accessed by multiple threads at the same time.
- **`atomic`**: Provides thread-safe variables that can be safely accessed by multiple threads.

#### **Why These Are Used**
- ROS libraries are necessary for communicating with Gazebo and controlling the drone.
- Threading and synchronization tools (`thread`, `mutex`, `atomic`) are used to handle multiple tasks simultaneously (e.g., updating the drone’s position and computing velocity commands).

### **2. PIDController Class**
```cpp
class PIDController {
public:
 PIDController(double kp, double ki, double kd, double dt)
 : kp_(kp), ki_(ki), kd_(kd), dt_(dt), integral_(0), prev_error_(0) {}
 double compute(double setpoint, double measurement) {
 double error = setpoint - measurement;
 integral_ += error * dt_;
 double derivative = (error - prev_error_) / dt_;
 prev_error_ = error;
 return kp_ * error + ki_ * integral_ + kd_ * derivative;
 }
 void setGains(double kp, double ki, double kd) {
 kp_ = kp;
 ki_ = ki;
 kd_ = kd;
 integral_ = 0; // Reset integral when gains change
 }
private:
 double kp_, ki_, kd_, dt_, integral_, prev_error_;
};
```

#### **What It Does**
This class implements a **PID controller**, which is a control algorithm used to adjust the drone’s velocity based on the difference between its current position and the target position.

#### **Breakdown**
1. **Constructor**:
   - Initializes the PID gains (`kp_`, `ki_`, `kd_`), time step (`dt_`), and internal state variables (`integral_`, `prev_error_`).
   - Example: `PIDController(0.5, 0.01, 0.1, 0.1)` creates a PID controller with specific gains and a time step of 0.1 seconds.

2. **`compute` Method**:
   - Calculates the control output (velocity) based on the current error.
   - Steps:
     1. Compute the error: `error = setpoint - measurement`.
     2. Update the integral term: `integral_ += error * dt_`.
     3. Compute the derivative term: `derivative = (error - prev_error_) / dt_`.
     4. Save the current error for the next iteration: `prev_error_ = error`.
     5. Return the control output: `kp_ * error + ki_ * integral_ + kd_ * derivative`.

3. **`setGains` Method**:
   - Allows the user to adjust the PID gains (`kp_`, `ki_`, `kd_`).
   - Resets the integral term to avoid sudden jumps in the control output.

#### **Why This Is Used**
- A PID controller is a standard method for controlling systems like drones because it can smoothly adjust the output based on the error and its history (integral and derivative terms).
- The `setGains` method allows tuning the controller for better performance.

### **3. Global Variables**
```cpp
std::string drone_name;
geometry_msgs::Twist cmd_vel;
geometry_msgs::Point current_pos, target_pos;
std::atomic<bool> target_set(false);
std::atomic<bool> position_received(false);
std::atomic<bool> stop_pid_thread(false);
std::atomic<bool> shutdown(false);
const double threshold = 0.1;
std::mutex data_mutex;
```

#### **What It Does**
These variables store shared data used throughout the program.

#### **Breakdown**
1. **`drone_name`**: Stores the name of the drone (passed as a command-line argument).
2. **`cmd_vel`**: Stores the velocity command to be sent to the drone.
3. **`current_pos` and `target_pos`**: Store the drone’s current and target positions.
4. **`std::atomic<bool>` Variables**:
   - `target_set`: Indicates whether a target position has been set.
   - `position_received`: Indicates whether the drone’s position has been received.
   - `stop_pid_thread`: Used to stop the PID control thread.
   - `shutdown`: Used to stop the entire program.
5. **`threshold`**: The distance threshold to consider the target reached.
6. **`data_mutex`**: A mutex to protect shared data (e.g., `cmd_vel`, `current_pos`, `target_pos`) from concurrent access.

#### **Why These Are Used**
- Global variables are used to share data between threads.
- `std::atomic` ensures thread-safe access to flags.
- `std::mutex` prevents data corruption when multiple threads access shared data simultaneously.

### **4. Main Function**
```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
 if (argc < 2) {
 std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " drone_name" << std::endl;
 return 1;
 }
 drone_name = argv[1];
 ros::init(argc, argv, "drone_control_node");
 ros::NodeHandle nh;
 vel_pub = nh.advertise<geometry_msgs::Twist>("/cmd_vel", 10);
 ros::Subscriber sub = nh.subscribe("/gazebo/model_states", 10, modelStatesCallback);
 std::thread callback_thread(callbackThread);
 ROS_INFO("Drone control node started for %s. Enter commands:", drone_name.c_str());
 ROS_INFO(" - 3 numbers: Target position (x y z)");
 ROS_INFO(" - 6 numbers: Velocity (vx vy vz wx wy wz)");
 ROS_INFO(" - 9 numbers: PID gains (kp_x ki_x kd_x kp_y ki_y kd_y kp_z ki_z kd_z)");
 ROS_INFO(" - 'a': Move left, 'd': Move right, 's': Move down, 'w': Move up (by 0.3m)");
 std::thread pid_thread; // Thread object for PID control
}
```

#### **What It Does**
The `main` function initializes the program, sets up ROS communication, and starts threads for handling position updates and PID control.

#### **Breakdown**
1. **Check Command-Line Arguments**:
   - Ensures the user provides the drone’s name as an argument.
   - Example: `./drone_control_node drone1`.

2. **Initialize ROS**:
   - `ros::init`: Initializes the ROS node with the name `drone_control_node`.
   - `ros::NodeHandle`: Provides access to ROS communication tools.

3. **Set Up Publishers and Subscribers**:
   - `vel_pub`: Publishes velocity commands to the `/cmd_vel` topic.
   - `sub`: Subscribes to the `/gazebo/model_states` topic to receive position updates.

4. **Start Threads**:
   - `callback_thread`: Runs the `callbackThread` function to process position updates.
   - `pid_thread`: Will run the `pidControlThread` function (not shown in the snippet).

5. **Print Instructions**:
   - Provides the user with commands to control the drone.

#### **Why This Is Used**
- The `main` function sets up the program’s infrastructure and starts the necessary threads for concurrent operation.
